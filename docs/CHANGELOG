0.9
  * Fixed a lot of bugs in the HTML tokenizer
  * Added mode-togglable functions possible (See README under Handler Functions
  * The HTML tokenizer will now highlight CSS found in style tags

0.8.5
  * Rewrote the HTML tokenizer to use a state transition table as the CSS
    tokenizer does (might as well keep it consistent.) This is faster, more
    accurate (html comments match the standard), cleaner, and easier to expand.

0.8.3
  * Added new CSS tokenizer, this one actually uses a state transition table
    which made it about a million times cleaner and easier to write.
  * Small change to options so that it will, by default, convert raw tabs to
    two spaces.

0.8.2
  * Syntax files can specify an HTML background color now (see php.syn for an
    example) This background color wont apply to the command line
  * Reduced HTML filesizes by ~10% by removing all similar classes and
    replacing them with the basemost highlighting identifier ie.,
    T_OPEN_TAG -> PHP_TAG -> DELIMITER will now just be
        .DELIMITER{color: #fff;}
          instead of
        .DELIMITER,.PHP_TAG,.T_OPEN_TAG{color:#fff;}
    With the html tag being <span class="DELIMITER">... instead of of
    <span class="T_OPEN_TAG">...
  * Completely removed support for actually putting SGR sequences in the
    syntax files. It is all HTML based now. (Who wants to remember SGR
    sequences anyway?)
  * Added a default syntax file and tokenizer to provide a base for the others
  * Added a phpDoc handler for the PHP highlighter to highlight doctags

0.8.1
  * Added support for HTML colors in the syntax files. The highlighter will
    automatically convert HTML colors to the appropriate 8-color SGR sequence
    so feel free to use whatever you like.
  * Updated the bundled syntax files in conjunction with the previous change

0.8
  * Changed the way custom handlers work in syntax files. Instead of returning
    a highlighted string they should return a tokenset just as the main tokenize
    function does, this allows for recursion without hackery.
    See the README for updated documenation on how to write the handler funcs
  * Massive updates to the bundled HTML tokenizer so it handles comments,
    DOCTYPE, strings and self-closing tags correctly
  * Small updates to the bundled syntax files to take into account the new
    features and changes to the tokenizers.
  * Added support for comments in the syntax files
  * Added a -o <outfile> switch which highlights using HTML (line numbering
    currently doesn't work in HTML output)

0.7.1
  * Added ability to link tokens in syntax files
  * You can now specify human readable colors in the syntax files
    as well as the SGR code, ie.,
T_TAG_START    red
T_TAG_END      T_TAG_START
T_HTML_COMMENT 36

0.7
  * This was the initial build/rebuild that introduced using external
    tokenizers and syntax files, the details of the individual changes
    weren't tracked.
